## Welcome to HighLevelProgrammingLanguage!

Hey there, welcome to the HighLevelProgrammingLanguage repository! Here, we're all about diving into the world of high-level programming languages. Whether you're just starting out or you're a seasoned developer, you've come to the right place to explore and learn.

## What it contains.

### Languages Included
- Python
- JavaScript
- Ruby

### Sample Codes
Let's kick things off with some sample code snippets to get you started:

#### Python
Python, known for its simplicity and readability, is a fantastic language to begin with. Here's a classic "Hello World" example:
